    <h1>Hello Everybody!</h1>
    <div class="columns">
        <p>GitHub is aaaaaaaa code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                
                This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.</p>
        <p>Step 1. Create a Repository
                A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
                
                Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.</p>
        <p>Step 2. Create a Branch
                Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
                
                By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
                
                When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
                
                This diagram shows:
                
                The master branch
                A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)</p>
