                GitHub is aaaaaaaa code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                
                This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.</p>
        <p>Step 1. Create a Repository
                A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
                
                Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.</p>
